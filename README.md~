Grimoire is the world's premier book-reading simulator. Thrill to the slow 
turning of pages. Marvel at the gibberish Latin contained therein.

Grimoire uses python 2.x, pyglet (Python OpenGL library), numpy, and loremipsum. To install, just copy the repository. Run main.py with python to experience
the magic.
